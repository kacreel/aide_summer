# Class 3: Using ML for Fairness Themed Tasks - Lecture Guide

## Overview
Exploration of fairness in machine learning through hands-on analysis using the What-If Tool and COMPAS dataset.

## Pre-Class Reading and Exploration
### Required Materials:
1. **Equivant Response to ProPublica Article**
   - [Response demonstrating accuracy, equity, and predictive parity](https://www.equivant.com/response-to-propublica-demonstrating-accuracy-equity-and-predictive-parity/)

2. **What-If Tool Tutorial**
   - [Detailed walkthrough with census dataset](https://pair-code.github.io/what-if-tool/learn/tutorials/walkthrough/)
   - [Web-based demo for walkthrough](https://pair-code.github.io/what-if-tool/demos/uci.html)
   - Note: Use web-based demo - don't download data or set up notebooks unless desired

## Class Schedule

### Session 1: What-If Tool Exploration
**Guided exploration of What-If Tool**
- Introduction to fairness concepts
- Understanding bias in ML models
- Interactive model analysis

### Session 2: COMPAS Dataset Analysis
**Hands-on Analysis**
- **Tool:** [What-If Tool COMPAS Demo](https://pair-code.github.io/what-if-tool/demos/compas.html)
- **Worksheet:** [Analysis Worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XRQTGwyYw6vZ4e2LGDVSM8BEfbxoY16BLYA5OnLF8O8/edit?usp=sharing)
  - Students will need to copy to their drive to edit
  - Alternative: Print spaced-out copy for handwritten notes
- **Solutions:** [Worksheet Solutions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18fClKdqIS4ouugKD4er41NyKKsVny_Txk8Wwl51IPJI/edit?usp=sharing)

### Session 3: Group Discussion and Analysis
- Share findings from COMPAS analysis
- Discuss implications of biased algorithms
- Explore fairness metrics and trade-offs

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this class, students should be able to:
- Understand the concept of algorithmic fairness
- Use the What-If Tool for model analysis
- Identify potential sources of bias in ML models
- Analyze fairness metrics in real-world scenarios
- Critically evaluate ML model performance across different groups

## Key Concepts
- **Algorithmic Fairness:** Ensuring ML models don't discriminate
- **COMPAS:** Criminal risk assessment tool controversy
- **Bias Detection:** Methods for identifying unfair model behavior
- **Fairness Metrics:** Different ways to measure and define fairness

## Materials Needed
- Computer with internet access
- Google account for document copying
- Access to What-If Tool demos
- Printed worksheets (optional)

## Teaching Notes
- Focus on real-world impact of biased algorithms
- Encourage critical thinking about fairness definitions
- Be prepared to discuss ethical implications
- Have alternative exercises ready for different skill levels
- Consider guest speaker from ethics/policy background
