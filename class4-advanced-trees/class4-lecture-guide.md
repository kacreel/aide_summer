## Overview
Comprehensive ML fairness analysis using the COMPAS recidivism dataset, covering decision trees, fairness metrics, and multiple algorithm comparison.

## Class Schedule

### Session 1: COMPAS Dataset & Ethics (25 minutes)
- Load and clean COMPAS recidivism dataset 
- Understand criminal justice ML implications

### Session 2: Decision Tree Modeling (30 minutes)
- Train decision trees for recidivism prediction
- Evaluate performance vs. original COMPAS algorithm

### Session 3: Fairness Analysis (35 minutes)
- Implement FairLearn library
- Calculate fairness metrics: Demographic Parity, False Positive Rate, Equalized Odds
- Visualize disparities and trade-offs

### Session 4: Multi-Algorithm Comparison (25 minutes)
- Compare Random Forest, SVM, and KNN
- Evaluate accuracy vs. fairness across models

## Learning Objectives
Students will learn to:
- **Analyze** COMPAS criminal justice dataset with ethical context
- **Build** decision tree classifiers and compare with benchmarks  
- **Assess** ML fairness using FairLearn metrics and visualizations
- **Compare** multiple algorithms (Random Forest, SVM, KNN) for performance and fairness
- **Understand** real-world impact of algorithmic bias in criminal justice
