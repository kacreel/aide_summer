# Class 7: Fitting Your Own Models and Capstone Introduction - Lecture Guide

## Overview
Introduction to the capstone project with hands-on model deployment using Hugging Face and Google Colab.

## Pre-Class Learning (2 hr 30 minutes)
### Required Materials:
1. **Programming Homework** (2 hours)
   - See "Programming HW Email.pdf" for details
