## Learning Objectives & Key Concepts
By the end of this class, students should be able to:

### 🔍 Privacy Attack Techniques
- Perform **linkage attacks** using auxiliary information to re-identify individuals
- Execute **differencing attacks** on aggregate statistics
- Demonstrate how **aggregation** can still leak individual information
- Understand why traditional **de-identification** methods fail

### 🛡️ Differential Privacy Fundamentals  
- Define **differential privacy** and its mathematical framework
- Explain the **privacy-utility trade-off** in data analysis
- Work with **epsilon (ε)** and **delta (δ)** privacy parameters
- Implement **noise addition mechanisms** (Laplacian noise)

### 🔧 Practical Implementation
- Use **PyDP** library for differential privacy algorithms
- Apply **BoundedSum**, **BoundedMean**, **Count**, and **Max** functions
- Implement the **randomized response** technique for sensitive surveys
- Compare privacy-preserving vs. non-private analysis results

### 📊 Real-world Applications
- Understand **personally identifiable information (PII)** vulnerabilities  
- Recognize the limitations of **anonymization** and **pseudonymization**
- Apply differential privacy to **survey data** and **statistical queries**
- Connect privacy techniques to **regulatory compliance** (GDPR, CCPA)
